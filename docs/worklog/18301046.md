### Init Kubernetes

 - [x] Shell installation script
 - [ ] Finish installation on every node

During this process, we met a serious network authority problem. BJTU's Authority System redirect all HTTP requests to its authority gateway.

### Make Network Great Again

GFW has a little influence in IPv6, so the first idea is transferring all public IPv4 requests into IPv6 using NAT64/DNS64.

#### Systemd-resolved

In Ubuntu 18.04, DNS service is handled by Systemd-resolved. It seems very useful in document. Just in document.In fact, it's very terrible, After manually config Public DNS64 Server, the DNS server which is provided by DHCPv4 will still be used.

Set disable dns on ens3 by `netplan` doesn't works too.

So finally, I disabled systemd-resolved, manually manage all DNS setting.

#### DNS64

Well, Google's service need to build your own NAT64 server in LAN, obviously I can't use it simply.

After change DNS, I make default IPv4 route prefer to loopback interface to block all v4 request.

| Provider                   | Address                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A10 Networks               | `2001:67c:27e4:15::6411` |
| PaloAlto Networks Firewall | `2001:67c:27e4::64`      |
| Jool                       | `2001:67c:27e4:15::64`   |
| Cisco ASR1000              | `2001:67c:27e4::60`      |

I tried those servers above, and the bad news is when they met a dual stack domain, It will do nothing to raw response. And google's package server is also banned in IPv6. It seems that I need to build my own NAT64 server or install vpn on those vps.

## 30 Jun 2020

Today i'll try build my own NAT64 server at first. I will install vpn if my NAT64 doesn't work.

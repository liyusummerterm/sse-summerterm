> Will you join in our crusade?  
Who will be strong and stand with me?  
Beyond the barricade  
Is there a world you long to see?  
Then join in the fight  
That will give you the right to be free  

> Do you hear the people sing?  
Singing a song of angry men?  
It is the music of a people  
Who will not be slaves again  

> When the beating of your heart  
Echoes the beating of the drums  
There is a life about to start  
When tomorrow comes  

It's time to destory the damn GFW.

Without GFW, I could save more than half of time&works.

## 29 Jun 2020

### Init Kubernetes

 - [x] Shell installation script
 - [ ] Finish installation on every node

During this process, we met a serious network authority problem. BJTU's Authority System redirect all HTTP requests to its authority gateway.

### Make Network Great Again

GFW has a little influence in IPv6, so the first idea is transferring all public IPv4 requests into IPv6 using NAT64/DNS64.

#### Systemd-resolved

In Ubuntu 18.04, DNS service is handled by Systemd-resolved. It seems very useful in document. Just in document.In fact, it's very terrible, After manually config Public DNS64 Server, the DNS server which is provided by DHCPv4 will still be used.

Set disable dns on ens3 by `netplan` doesn't works too.

So finally, I disabled systemd-resolved, manually manage all DNS setting.

#### DNS64

Well, Google's service need to build your own NAT64 server in LAN, obviously I can't use it simply.

After change DNS, I make default IPv4 route prefer to loopback interface to block all v4 request.

| Provider                   | Address                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| A10 Networks               | `2001:67c:27e4:15::6411` |
| PaloAlto Networks Firewall | `2001:67c:27e4::64`      |
| Jool                       | `2001:67c:27e4:15::64`   |
| Cisco ASR1000              | `2001:67c:27e4::60`      |

I tried those servers above, and the bad news is when they met a dual stack domain, It will do nothing to raw response. And google's package server is also banned in IPv6. It seems that I need to build my own NAT64 server or install vpn on those vps.

## 30 Jun 2020

### Openvpn

Today i'll try build my own NAT64 server at first. I will install vpn if my NAT64 doesn't work.

Still use NAT64, but changed package source into tuna mirror, I make a progess in installing kubernetes. However, dual stack registy like gcr.io is still a problem.

Finally, I installed openvpn on every node, redirect all requests to Los Angles over IPV6.

### Network Plugin

It's easy now to startup a single node. But when it comes to cluster, a larger problem appears, every network department can't work at all, they can't communite each other, so the startup process hangs forever.

## 2 Jul 2020

### Still Network Plugin

| Name        | Works?       | Remarks           |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| Calico      | F            |                   |
| Cilium      | F            | Need add pod cidr |
| Contiv-VPP  | F            |                   |
| Kube-router | F            |                   |
| Weave Net   | Need Payment |                   |

And Then There Were None, but a lot of strange various logs.

## 3 Jul 2020

### Four legs good, two legs bad

Microk8s said it is **Zero-Ops**, I think i need have a try.

It doesn't work at first just like kubeadm, but i found that `iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT` should be executed on all nodes. And finally, it works.

## 4 Jul 2020

### Helm

Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications — Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application.

Charts are easy to create, version, share, and publish — so start using Helm and stop the copy-and-paste.

Sounds great, but it is more like a template engine for kubernetes. Helm 2 has a daemon container called Tiller in k8s to manage its status, so it is easier than Helm 3 when running in kubernetes.

### Jenkins

The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

With a huge privilege, jenkins is focused by many hackers. When i was in high school, my server has been hacked by a jenkins' security problem. And the hacker got root privilege and installed rootkit. So run it in container is very essential.

## 5 Jul 2020

### CI

CI in container have big difference from normal environment, you can't save any status between every build to save the environment build time.

And You don't have the privilege to install essential dependence inside jnlp container. So i just write a "Hello world" Jenkinsfile today.

## 6 Jul 2020

### Continuous Build & Test

Jenkins' Kubernetes plugin could change the builder pod configuration so that use privileged dependences

## 7 Jul 2020

### Kubeflow

## 8 Jul 2020

### Build Image in k8s -- Kaniko 

## 9 Jul 2020

### Faster Build

| Name     | Privileged                                         | Registry Cache | Speed  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| Kaniko   | No                                                 | No             | Slow   |
| Img      | No                                                 | No             | Normal |
| Buildkit | Unprivileged is a beta function and maybe unstable | Yes            | Fast   |

#### [Buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)

BuildKit is another tool for build image without docker, however, it latest version has a bug which causes a problem in pushing to plainHTTP registry.

This bug was introduced on 6 Mar 2020 by commit [2c3cf11fde5910839092199ef99389401a545625](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/commit/2c3cf11fde5910839092199ef99389401a545625#diff-90c6ef971c28bb3079af647d9a3c4c09), in the modification of `util/push/push.go`. The author forget a parameter `insecure`. Because he widely changed program's logic across lots of file, it is not easy to fix it quickly.

So I downgrade its version.

### Kubeflow & A huge bug in k8s

[Issue #260](https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/issues/260)

After several day's effort, i finally manually runs my own pod in k8s to find out where's the bug.

Microk8s didn't use any Storage Plugin because it is designed to be used in single node or very little cluster. However, for security problem, many service make their chart unprivileged, it will cause permission problem on any nodes except the master.

It can't set right owner on mount point and don't write 777 flag.

Although there are many ways to solve it. Neither of them sounds like a good idea.

#### Plan A

Manaully takeover the control of storage from microk8s. It's very complex, and all services rely on it, during the process all serivces will be totally down. And may spend lots of time even cause critical problems.

#### Plan B

Manaully takeover the control of **every** unprivileged pod from **every** service. And manully add a permission init sequence said in the issue above. It's not very complex, but it is not easy to takeover the full control of some services' configuration.

#### Plan C

Manaully takeover the control of **every** unprivileged pod from **every** service. And manully lock them on master node. It is the simplest way but it will lose the meaning of cluster.

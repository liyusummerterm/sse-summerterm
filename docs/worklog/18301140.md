<br/>
<font size=5>1. Learn vue.js to prepare for front-end development.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Try git commit.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>3. Communicate with teammates about work project.</font>
<br/>

<br/>
##2020.07.01 A.M.
<br/>
<font size=5>1. Try to use vue.js to build a web page, and keep study usage of component at the same time.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Communicate with teammates and give a plan of finishing building the front-end framework today. Refine the specific structure of our web page and then refine division of work.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>3. Search for some suitable elements for our web page based on element-ui.</font>
<br/>

<br/>
##2020.07.01 P.M.
<br/>
<font size=5>1. I have added components to our web page. In this process, I spend time on putting elements to our web page and formatting. I found some elements couldn't display on our web page, so I will spend time finding the reasons tonight.</font>

<br/>
##2020.07.02 P.M.
<br/>
<font size=5>1. Learn bootstrap quickly. Because the framework built by my teammate is in bootstrap, so I try to use component of bootstrap instead of vue. I found it is easier than I thought to be.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Add login part to the main web page, so the user can login his/her account, and then users can be managed by user management module.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>3. For me, I've got the basic skills of designing web pages, but I'm still very unskilled with js. So I plan to learn more about js tonight.</font>
<br/>

<br/>
##2020.07.03 P.M.
<br/>
<font size=5>1. Give index.html a better layout, and implemented page jump of login.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Learn about web route and url, trying to do prepare for frontend routing. To tell the truth, it is difficult to understand for me.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>3. When I try to push my changes to github, failure "non-fast-forward" happened. When I try to rebase, it warns me "cannot rebase onto multiple branches". After searching and giving many times of try, I fixed the conflict of the files and push my codes to github successfully. The error occurred because I didn't sync the latest version from the remote to local and made a mistaken operation of "rebase" earlier. Almost everyday I learn something of using git.</font>

##2020.07.05
<br/>
<font size=5>1. Learn about ajax and write some demos using ajax.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Try to understand the concept of SPA and try to use it in our completed web pages. Speedy result of study in a short period of time is limited, so it's a little slow for me to make ideas become right codes.</font>
<br/>

<br/>
##2020.07.06-07
<br/>
<font size=5>1. Try to add user management to frontend. Adding components often made the program report errors, and I am still finding reasons for it.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Since there doesn't be a lot of work to do of the frontend, my team leader has arranged for me to do some project management stuff instead. Today I'm making a Gantt chart for our project.</font>
<br/>

<br/>
##2020.07.08
<br/>
<font size=5>1. Finish Gantt chart.</font>
<br/>
<font size=5>2. Start to write project documentation.</font>

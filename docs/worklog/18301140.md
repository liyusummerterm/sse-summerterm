## 2020.06.30 A.M.
1. Learn vue.js to prepare for front-end development.
2. Try git commit.
3. Communicate with teammates about work project.



## 2020.07.01 A.M.

1. Try to use vue.js to build a web page, and keep study usage of component at the same time.

2. Communicate with teammates and give a plan of finishing building the front-end framework today. Refine the specific structure of our web page and then refine division of work.

3. Search for some suitable elements for our web page based on element-ui.

   


## 2020.07.01 P.M.

1. I have added components to our web page. In this process, I spend time on putting elements to our web page and formatting. I found some elements couldn't display on our web page, so I will spend time finding the reasons tonight.

   


## 2020.07.02 P.M.

1. Learn bootstrap quickly. Because the framework built by my teammate is in bootstrap, so I try to use component of bootstrap instead of vue. I found it is easier than I thought to be.
2. Add login part to the main web page, so the user can login his/her account, and then users can be managed by user management module.
3. For me, I've got the basic skills of designing web pages, but I'm still very unskilled with js. So I plan to learn more about js tonight.



## 2020.07.03 P.M.

1. Give index.html a better layout, and implemented page jump of login.
2. Learn about web route and url, trying to do prepare for frontend routing. To tell the truth, it is difficult to understand for me.
3. When I try to push my changes to github, failure "non-fast-forward" happened. When I try to rebase, it warns me "cannot rebase onto multiple branches". After searching and giving many times of try, I fixed the conflict of the files and push my codes to github successfully. The error occurred because I didn't sync the latest version from the remote to local and made a mistaken operation of "rebase" earlier. Almost everyday I learn something of using git.



## 2020.07.05

1. Learn about ajax and write some demos using ajax.
2. Try to understand the concept of SPA and try to use it in our completed web pages. Speedy result of study in a short period of time is limited, so it's a little slow for me to make ideas become right codes.
   


## 2020.07.06-07

1. Try to add user management to frontend. Adding components often made the program report errors, and I am still finding reasons for it.
2. Since there doesn't be a lot of work to do of the frontend, my team leader has arranged for me to do some project management stuff instead. Today I'm making a Gantt chart for our project.
